Inspiration

Our team focused on the topic- “There have been a lot of cyber attacks/scams/phishing attempts recently in the news. Can you think of a good way to utilize AI/ML technology to mitigate some of these attacks?”. We pondered over the question and concluded that most of the Cyber Attacks are a result of the user being less informed than the actual attack being threatening itself. There are Millions of documents on the internet explain the ways to prevent cybercrime but majority of the people do not read them. Comes in CyberMaze

What it does

The First of it’s kind in Cyber Education, CyberMaze is an interactive game that helps the user learn the ways to avoid Cyber Crime/Breaches using various levels of mazes and a plethora of assets. It’s integrated AI Bot ChatBot helps the user to delve deeper into various concepts of Cyber Security and the Development Process.

How we built it

Building a full-fledged game with a working AI Bot was nothing less than a grand challenge. Especially for people who are working on the tight time boundation we had and all of us having this as the very first program. Nevertheless, we all came together to implement the concept on a grand scale. We use various software’s ranging from Unity to IBM-Cloud to implementing various SDK’s. Therefore, efficiently dividing the work posed the main challenge. Kenneth and Jinge took care of the gaming side of things. Sohum and Vivek were responsible for taking care of the Bot.

Challenges we ran into

We encountered many difficulties when implementing our idea of making an interactive game about cybersecurity.

Although the design of our maze is aesthetically pleasing, it is way too complex for the simple Navmesh Agent to navigate through. Jinge tried hard to salvage the situation and made a simulation for aesthetics purposes.
Integrating the ChatBot to Unity was one of our major challenges. We initially coded the bot on Python but turns out that Unity does not integrate with Python. We then tried several softwares such as IronPython and Unity-Python to integrate the same but to no avail, when we almost lost hope, we came across IBM’s Watson Assistant. Implementing it was challenging as we had never dealt with AI before but it was finally a success.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
There is not enough space for us to write the accomplishments we are proud of. The whole Process was a hug challenge and we felt like quitting multiple times. But we finally puled through it and have a somewhat presentable product.

What we learned

1. Python 3 does not work with Unity.
2. Unity NavMesh
3. Watson Assistant
4. Advanced Concepts of C#
5. Hackathons are no joke and we have to decide our topics better next time if we do not want to lose sleep.

What's next for CyberMaze

If we can do so much in 24hrs, imagine what we can do in 2 weeks’ time, or even 2 months. We feel this is a revolutionary concept and has the potential to greatly reduce Cybercrimes. The interactive software will appeal both to the kids and the elderly. When people are better informed, we will have a better chance to tackle our future filled with both unlimited prospects and unlimited challenges.
